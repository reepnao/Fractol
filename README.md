# Fractol
One of the first graphical projects at 42 school, fract-ol generates beautiful fractals from the complex numbers of an iterative mathematical construct. A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales. This project uses the school's graphical library, MiniLibX.

## Executing Fract-ol

At execution time, you must specify a fractal to display. You may also provide other optional parameters:

```shell
./fractol <type> <options>
```
